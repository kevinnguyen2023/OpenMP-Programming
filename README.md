# OpenMP-Programming
Modified a serial implementation of the algorithm to get an OpenMP parallel implementation in C. The program must get the number of threads before forking any threads within the command lines in Linux. Uses reduction clauses to specify thread-private variables. Implemented timing functions to compare run times and accuracy between the serial algorithm and OpenMP algorithm. Determined that this program is scalable and collected speedup data.
